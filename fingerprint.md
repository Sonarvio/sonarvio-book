# Fingerprint

To identify an audio track, a unique signature with its characteristic features is going to be created. [Various implementations](https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Fingerprinting) of such acoustic fingerprint already exist, although only a few of them are open source and free to use. The most promising one were [Echoprint](http://echoprint.me/) and [Chromaprint](https://acoustid.org/chromaprint), while in the end neither of them acutally fits for this scenario.

The best match could be achieved by comparing the actual serialized data of a track. Different implementations already exists, which allow to generate a code which can be looked up.
