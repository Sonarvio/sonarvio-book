# Fingerprint






This is not a rant about ...

Currently there are 2 acuoustin systems opn source systems used.
Compared to the proieraty solutoions of companies .... its rather limited.

Nevertheless I thought it makes it probably easier to pick a
solution and port it to the browser.



Acoustic Fingerprint

The best match could be achieved by comparing the actual serialized data of a track. Different implementations already exists, which allow to generate a code which can be looked up.
